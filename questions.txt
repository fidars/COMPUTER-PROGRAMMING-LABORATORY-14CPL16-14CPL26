1. 	Design and develop a flowchart or an algorithm that takes three
	coefficients (a, b, and c) of a Quadratic equation (ax2+bx+c=0) as input
	and compute all possible roots. Implement a C program for the
	developed flowchart/algorithm and execute the same to output the
	possible roots for a given set of coefficients with appropriate
	messages.

2. 	Design and develop an algorithm to find the reverse of an integer
	number NUM and check whether it is PALINDROME or NOT. Implement
	a C program for the developed algorithm that takes an integer
	number as input and output the reverse of the same with suitable
	messages. Ex: Num: 2014, Reverse: 4102, Not a Palindrome

3a. Design and develop a flowchart to find the square root of a given
	number N. Implement a C program for the same and execute for all 
	possible inputs with appropriate messages. Note: Don’t use library
	function sqrt(n).

3b. Design and develop a C program to read a year as an input and find
	whether it is leap year or not. Also consider end of the centuries.
	
4. 	Design and develop an algorithm to evaluate polynomial 
	f(x) = (a4)(x^4) + (a3)(x^3) + (a2)(x^2) + (a1)x + a0, for a given 
	value of x and its coefficients using Horner’s method. Implement a 
	C program for the same and execute the program with different set of
	values of coefficients and x.

5. 	Draw the flowchart and Write a C Program to compute Sin(x) using
	Taylor series approximation given by Sin(x) = x - (x^3/3!) + (x^5/5!) -	(x^7/7!) + …….

6. 	Compare your result with the built- in Library function. Print both the
	results with appropriate messages.

7. 	Develop an algorithm, implement and execute a C program that reads N
	integer numbers and arrange them in ascending order using Bubble Sort.

8. 	Develop, implement and execute a C program that reads two matrices
	A (m x n) and B (p x q) and Compute product of matrices A and B.
	Read matrix A and matrix B in row major order and in column major
	order respectively. Print both the input matrices and resultant matrix
	with suitable headings and output should be in matrix format only.
	Program must check the compatibility of orders of the matrices for
	multiplication. Report appropriate message in case of incompatibility.

9. 	Develop, implement and execute a C program to search a Name in a list
	of names using Binary searching Technique.

10. Write and execute a C program that,
	i. 	Implements string copy operation STRCOPY (str1, str2) that
		copiesa string str1 to another string str2 without using library
		function.
	ii. Read a sentence and print frequency of vowels and total count
		of consonants.

11. 
  a. 	Design and develop a C function RightShift(x ,n) that takes two
		integers x and n as input and returns value of the integer x rotated to
		the right by n positions. Assume the integers are unsigned. Write a C
		program that invokes this function with different values for x and n
		and tabulate the results with suitable headings.
		
	b. 	Design and develop a C function isprime (num) that accepts an integer
		argument and returns 1 if the argument is prime, a 0 otherwise. Write
		a C program that invokes this function to generate prime numbers
		between the given range.
		Draw the flowchart and write a recursive C function to find the
		factorial of a number, n!, defined by fact(n)=1, if n=0. Otherwise fact
		(n) =n*fact (n-1). Using this function, write a C program to compute
		the binomial coefficient nCr. Tabulate the results for different values 
		of n and r with suitable messages.

12. Given two university information files “studentname.txt” and “usn.txt”
	 that contains students Name and USN respectively. Write a C program
	to create a new file called “output.txt” and copy the content of files
	“studentname.txt” and “usn.txt” into output file in the sequence shown
	below. Display the contents of output file “output.txt” on to the screen
			_________________________________________
			|Student Name	      | USN       	|
			|---------------------------------------|
			|Name1		      | USN1	    	|
			|---------------------------------------|
			|Name2		      | USN3		|
			|---------------------------------------|
			| .....		      | .....		|
			|---------------------------------------|
			| .....		      | .....		|
			|_______________________________________|
			
13. Write a C program to maintain a record of n student details using an
	array of structures with four fields (Roll number, Name, Marks, and
	Grade). Assume appropriate data type for each field. Print the marks
	of the student, given the student name as input.

14. Write a C program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and
	standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers.
